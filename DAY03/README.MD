# JavaScript Basics - Day 03

This project covers various basic concepts of JavaScript, including operators, expressions, and data types. Below is an overview of the topics covered in the `index.js` file.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Increment (`++`)
- Decrement (`--`)

### 2. Assignment Operators
- Assignment (`=`)
- Addition assignment (`+=`)
- Subtraction assignment (`-=`)
- Multiplication assignment (`*=`)
- Division assignment (`/=`)

### 3. Comparison Operators
- Equal (`==`)
- Not equal (`!=`)
- Strict equal (`===`)
- Strict not equal (`!==`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Greater than or equal (`>=`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Less than or equal (`<=`)

### 4. Logical Operators
- AND (`&&`)
- OR (`||`)
- NOT (`!`)
- Nullish coalescing (`??`)

### 5. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
- Syntax: `condition ? value1 : value2`

### 6. Bitwise Operators
- AND (`&`)
- OR (`|`)
- XOR (`^`)
- NOT (`~`)
- Left shift (`<<`)
- Right shift (`>>`)

### 7. Grouping
- Using parentheses to group expressions and control the order of operations.

### 8. Type Checking
- `typeof` operator to check the type of a variable.
- `instanceof` operator to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor.

## Usage

To run the JavaScript code, open the `index.js` file in a JavaScript runtime environment (such as Node.js) or in a web browser console.

```bash
node index.js
