# Variables in JavaScript  

Variables in JavaScript are used to store and manage data. They can hold different types of values such as numbers, strings, objects, or functions. JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:  

- **var** – Function-scoped and can be re-declared or updated.  
- **let** – Block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.  
- **const** – Block-scoped and cannot be re-declared or updated after assignment.  

## Example  

```javascript
var x = 10;  // Function-scoped  
let y = 20;  // Block-scoped  
const z = 30; // Cannot be reassigned
